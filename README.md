# 🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Image Classification  

This project focuses on building a **deep learning model** to classify images of cats and dogs using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. The model is trained on a dataset of cat and dog images, leveraging the power of **TensorFlow/Keras** for image recognition tasks.  

## 🔑 Key Features  
- 📊 **Data Preprocessing:** Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve model performance.  
- 🧠 **CNN Architecture:** Multiple convolutional, pooling, and dense layers for robust feature extraction.  
- 🚀 **Training & Evaluation:** Model trained with training/validation datasets, evaluated with accuracy and loss curves.  
- 📷 **Prediction:** Classifies new/unseen images as either *Cat* or *Dog*.  
- 📈 **Visualization:** Training history and prediction samples are plotted for better insights.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy & Pandas  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
